PROJECT NAME -: Forest Fire Data Analysis.

*Reason to Choose these Project: To find out the state in which fire is in large number to find out the month in which fire occured more to find out the monthly analysis of fire to predict the fires in upcoming year.

*Pandas Methods which are used in these project I used groupby where i need the reference of some other column. I have used unique method to neglect the copies I used catplot where the data is more and to visualize it properly. I have used polynomial equation to analyze data and predict upcoming data.

*Graph which are used : Piechart Lineplot Bargraph Catplot

*Workdone Read and clean the data and formating it. finding to number of fires in month, year and states Worst fire hit in top 5 states analysis on which month catches fire mostly. Polynomial equation to predict the upcoming year fire analysis

#Conclusion

February, March, April and May see the lowest number of forest fires July, August, October and November are the 4 months where maximum forest fires happen

Mato Grosso see a huge number of forest fires Sergipe, Distrito Federal, Alagoas and Espirito Santo see the lowest number of forest fires

Fires increased dramatically in the last 20 years, from 20,000 in 1998 to almost double in 2017. What's also alarming is that there is also an increasing trend in the data, so we can expect even more wildfires in the years to follow. 2003 and 2016 had the most wildfires throughout Brazil.

From 1998 to 2017, Mato Grosso has contained huge number of forest fires. Overall, until 2017, the amount of forest fires since 1998 has trended up over the years, though it was never as bad as 2004. Based on the most recent frequential and proportional trends in individual states, efforts should be put forward most in the states of Mato Grosso, Paraiba, Rio, Ceara, and Rondomia. Overall, the months of July through November deserve the most attention in preventing forest fires.

#Result :-

After Analysis we can see that the forest fire is mostly occured in the second half of year, ie; July to November So to avoid the Fire in Upcoming year, we can ask the forest authorities to have more attention in second half year and plan accordingly about the prevention before hand to avoid Fire in that second half year duration.
